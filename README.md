# cube-solver

This is a C++ application to solve a Rubik's Cube.

The method employed is a standard layer by layer method using
OLL and PLL to solve the final layer.

## How to use it

When you run the program, you will be prompted to enter a scramble.

Scrambles should follow standard cube notation, which you can read
about [here](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/notation/).

The cube can be in any orientation at the time of the scramble, and whichever
color ends up at the bottom once the cube is finished scrambling is chosen
to be the cross color.
